## Problem Statement <br />
The dataset being analysed contains information about customers, their annual income and their spending score. There is a need to analyse this data in order to gain useful insights that would benefit upcoming strategies. Clustering analyses would help reveal hidden gems within the data that would facilitate further actions to be taken on the data.

## Research Questions <br />
- Can KMeans clusters reveal trends and patterns in consumer behaviour using data? <br />

## Aim and Objectives <br />
The aim of this project is to gain useful insights from the data <br />
The objectives are: <br />
- To carry out univariate and bivariate analyses on the data <br />
- To also execute univariate, bivariate and multivariate clustering on the data <br />
- To summarize the results <br />

## Project Specifications <br />
The project was carried out in the Jupyter IDE using python programming language. <br />

## Key Findings <br />
### Univariate and Bivariate Analyses <br />
- The univariate analyses revealed the distribution of the incomes and spending score both generally and according to gender. These averages indicate the spending power and behaviour of the customers which can aid in pricing and pricing models. <br />
- The bivariate analyses illustrated the relationships that exist between the spending score and the annual income, as well as between all other variables. <br />
### Clusterings <br />
- The univariate clustering revealed that the income of the customers can be clustered into three classes. They have similar average spending score and are of similar ages. The clusters however indicated that their customers can be divided into low, medium and upper income classes. <br />
- The bivariate analysis further described how the customer spend their money. The customers were clustered into 5 groups. The first one was age 25 earning about 25k with a high spending score of 79. Next, age 45 earning about 26k with a lower spending score of about 21. The third cluster was aged 41 with an income of 88k having an even lower spending score of 17. After that was the group aged 32 earning about 86k with the highest spending score of 82. Finally, the group aged 42 making about 55k with a spending score of 49. <br />
- The multivariate clustering analyses further split the groups by gender. <br />
## Conclusions: <br />
In conclusion, the results obtained from this exercise have revealed behavioural patterns of the customers. These patterns can then aid in future strategy decisions for the company whose data this is!
